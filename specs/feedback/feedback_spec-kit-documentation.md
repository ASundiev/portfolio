## 1. Hero section

1.1. The hero section currently takes the full height of the viewport — this is inconsistent with the design, where the height of the hero section is determined by content and paddings.
1.2. Navigation bar isn't sticky despite the fact that it was an explicit requirement from the annotations in design.


## 2. Why Me

2.1. Currently, this section appears with completely incorrect paddings. Check the design for reference.


## 3. Case Studies

3.1. The paddings and margins are incorrect, check the design for reference.


## 4. Articles & talks

4.1. I see that the section has unnecessary max-width. It's inconsistent with design.
